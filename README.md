logAlarm
========

help alarm that beeps logarithmically

we are all well known with this situation, we need to leave home to work\school\meeting\whatever and we set the timer far ahead enough to get a shower, make sandwich\salad\whatever

but suddenly we sit in the car and it is a little too late, and we are late by two minutes to class\office\meeting\whatever

this idea (logAlarm) has the perfect approach to give a solution to this problem.
it alarms you at each half of the time you set to yourself.

for example:
you need to get out at 9:40
set the wake up time to 8:40

the alarm beeps at:
9:10
9:25
9:32
9:36
9:38
9:39
9:39:30
9:39:45
9:39:52
9:39:56
9:39:58
9:39:59
9:39:59:30
9:39:59:45
...
at that point you should be annoyed enough to leave your house

you can set the alarm off at any time, but it only beeps a sharp tone each time so it only as a reminder, until you really need to get out...
